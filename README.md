# Credit Card Default Risk Analysis 💳📊

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **credit card default risk** using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify patterns in customer data that indicate whether a credit card user is likely to default on their payment in the next billing cycle.

The project is implemented using **Python** and developed in **Google Colab**, making use of popular data science and machine learning libraries.

## Problem Statement
Credit card default prediction is a critical task for financial institutions to:
- Minimize financial losses
- Improve risk management
- Make informed credit approval decisions

This project formulates the problem as a **binary classification task**, where the model predicts whether a customer will default or not.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset contains customer demographic information, credit history, and payment behavior.
- Features include:
  - Credit limit
  - Gender, education, marital status
  - Repayment status
  - Bill amounts
  - Payment amounts
- Target variable:
  - **Default payment (Yes/No)**

> Dataset is used only for educational and analytical purposes.

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature selection and scaling
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation and performance analysis

---

## Machine Learning Models
- Classification models applied to predict default risk
- Evaluation using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

---

## Results & Insights
- Identified key features influencing default behavior
